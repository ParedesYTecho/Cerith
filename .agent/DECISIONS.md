# Decisions

## D-001 — Clean start

Cerith starts in a clean repository.

WidgetOSD is legacy reference only.

## D-002 — Native Windows-first

Primary direction: C#/.NET/WinUI/Windows APIs.

## D-003 — Universal metric architecture

Widgets bind to Metric IDs, never directly to providers.

## D-004 — AI quotas start from zero

Legacy quota logic is not ported.

## D-005 — Truthful states

Missing, stale, estimated, unlimited and error states remain distinct.

## D-006 — Development workflow separate from product

Graphify, model routing and handoffs are development infrastructure.

## D-007 — Open-source direction

Cerith should be genuinely open source.

License remains provisional until dependency review.

## D-008 — Native translation of UI references

Web UI references inspire design; production runtime remains native.

## D-009 — Public-ready from first commit

No private information is permitted in committed history merely because the repository starts private.

## D-010 — Zero AI slop

Generated code receives normal engineering review.

Every new file, dependency and abstraction must justify its existence.
